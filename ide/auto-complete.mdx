## Overview

The Auto Complete feature in Onuro uses AI to predict and suggest code as you type, significantly speeding up your development process. This intelligent tool offers:

- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Provides code completions based on the current context of your project, including variables, functions, and libraries in use.
- **Language Support**: Works with a wide range of programming languages, adapting to syntax and conventions.
- **Learning from Your Code**: Improves suggestions over time by learning from your coding style and patterns.
- **Error Reduction**: Minimizes typos and syntax errors by offering complete snippets and statements.
- **Productivity Boost**: Reduces the need for manual typing, allowing you to focus on logic and problem-solving.

<Tip>
Ensure that your IDE extension is updated to the latest version to access the most advanced auto-complete capabilities.
