## Overview

<Note>
To enable codebase search, you need to set up embeddings in settings -> IDE -> Create Embeddings.
</Note>

The AI can semantically search through your codebase to help you navigate and understand your project more efficiently. This powerful feature allows you to:
- **Find relevant code sections**: Quickly locate specific functions, classes, or components by describing what they do in natural language.
- **Locate specific functionality**: Search for implementations of particular features or behaviors without needing to know exact file names or locations.
- **Identify similar patterns**: Discover code that matches certain patterns or structures, aiding in refactoring or understanding code consistency.
- **Navigate complex projects**: Easily jump to relevant parts of large codebases by querying concepts or functionality rather than specific terms.
- **Understand code relationships**: Find connections between different parts of your code by searching for related concepts or implementations.

<Tip>
Enable embeddings to take full advantage of semantic search. Without embeddings, the AI won't be able to search your codebase effectively. You can enable this by going to settings -> IDE -> Create Embeddings.
