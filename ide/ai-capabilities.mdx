## File Operations

The AI can perform various file operations to help you manage your project:

### Create Files
The AI can create new files in your project with appropriate content and structure.

### Edit Files
Allows the AI to make changes to existing files, including:
- Code modifications
- Content updates
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring

### Move Files
The AI can:
- Move files to different locations
- Rename files
- Reorganize your project structure

### Delete Files
Enables the AI to remove files when necessary, with your confirmation.

## Terminal Commands

The AI can run commands in its own terminal session, which is useful for:
- Setting up dependencies
- Running tests
- Debugging issues
- Building projects

<Warning>
The AI runs commands in an isolated terminal session to ensure safety and maintain your environment's integrity.
</Warning>

## Search Capabilities

### Codebase Search
<Note>
To enable codebase search, you need to set up embeddings in settings -> IDE -> Create Embeddings.
</Note>

The AI can semantically search through your codebase to help you navigate and understand your project more efficiently. This powerful feature allows you to:
- **Find relevant code sections**: Quickly locate specific functions, classes, or components by describing what they do in natural language.
- **Locate specific functionality**: Search for implementations of particular features or behaviors without needing to know exact file names or locations.
- **Identify similar patterns**: Discover code that matches certain patterns or structures, aiding in refactoring or understanding code consistency.
- **Navigate complex projects**: Easily jump to relevant parts of large codebases by querying concepts or functionality rather than specific terms.
- **Understand code relationships**: Find connections between different parts of your code by searching for related concepts or implementations.

<Tip>
Enable embeddings to take full advantage of semantic search. Without embeddings, the AI won't be able to search your codebase effectively. You can enable this by going to settings -> IDE -> Create Embeddings.
</Tip>

### Internet Search
Quick access to online resources:
- Documentation
- Examples
- Best practices
- Latest updates

### Deep Research
For complex queries, the AI can:
- Perform thorough internet research
- Analyze multiple sources
- Provide comprehensive findings
- Evaluate poorly documented APIs

<Warning>
Deep research takes longer but provides more detailed and accurate results.
</Warning>

## Image Capabilities

### Image Search
The AI can search the internet for relevant images to:
- Illustrate concepts
- Provide examples
- Add visual context

### Image Generation
Create custom images for:
- Diagrams
- Icons
- Illustrations
- Visual explanations

### Image Alteration
Modify existing images to:
- Adjust styling
- Add elements

## Document Generation

### PDF Creation
The AI can generate PDF documents for:
- Documentation
- Reports
- Presentations
- Specifications
