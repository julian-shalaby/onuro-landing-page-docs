## File Context Overview

Context management allows you to control which files and directories are visible to the AI during your conversation. This is crucial for getting accurate and relevant assistance.

### File Selection

The file selection dropdown is your primary tool for managing context:

- Add or remove files or directories as needed
- The AI always sees the contents of your currently focused file
- Easily add/remove files from your open file tabs
- Add entire directories or individual files using the "add contents" button

<Warning>
When adding a directory, all contents of all files under that directory will be included recursively. Be mindful of the amount of context you're adding.
</Warning>

## File Highlighting

When you highlight a range of text in a file, that selection will be emphasized in your next message to the AI. This feature allows you to:

- Easily reference specific parts of your code
- Focus the AI's attention on particular sections
- Get more precise assistance without explicitly describing the location

## Error Visibility

The AI can see any errors in your files, which helps it:

- Identify issues in your code
- Provide more accurate debugging assistance
- Suggest relevant fixes

## Important Messages

By default, only the 5 most recent turns of your conversation are kept. To retain important messages:

1. Click the 3 dots under the message
2. Select "important"

<Tip>
You can mark a message as important before sending it by typing "/important" in the input area and selecting the "important" command.
</Tip>

## External Links

You can paste links in the chat, and the contents of the webpage will be used as additional context. This is useful for:

- Referencing documentation
- Sharing examples
- Providing additional resources
